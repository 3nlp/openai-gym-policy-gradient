## Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient

The idea is to create a deep policy network that is intelligent enough to generalize to most games in OpenAI's Gym.

1) To run this code first install OpenAI's Gym: https://github.com/openai/gym

2) Download this repo and run `python run_carpole.py` to run the agent and see it improve over time.
